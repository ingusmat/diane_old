# Diane
A really simple API for blogging.

## Overview
Diane is, like Agent Cooper's assistant in Twin Peaks, a simple API that receives and serves
blog updates from and to whatever front-end you like.  It goes very will with React Native
and Next.js apps.

## Installation
Don't.  Not yet.  This thing isn't ready for that.
